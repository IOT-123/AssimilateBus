Arduino library for I2C communication from an ESP8266 master (this library) to an ATTINY85 slave (AssimilateBusSlave) on the auto logging (MQTT) and visualization (Crouton) platform: ASSIMILATE IOT NETWORK.

The metadata in the slaves should be ASSIM_VERSION 2, for the automatic Crouton configuration.
